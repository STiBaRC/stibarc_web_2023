The new STiBaRC Frontend for the future !

## Branches

### Main

The **main** branch is the production branch. This should be the most stable branch. Try not to push commits directly (use pull requests).

### Beta

The **beta** branch is for public bug checking. This branch should be more stable than the dev branch.

### Dev

The **dev** branch is for rapid development with the potential for breaking changes and is the least stable branch.
